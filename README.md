### Windows Improved SHell

![LS command](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Michael78912/wish/master/img/ls.PNG)

this aims at being an improved shell for windows.  
I started making this because I was fed up with cmd.exe  
I haven't thought of anything else to put here yet, so there you go.  

## UPDATE:  July 6, 2018
I've worked this into a somewhat usable state. it now supports calling external programs, a _few_ internal commands (many more being developed), and readline-style tab complete.  
built in commands so far include:

`ls`, `cd`, `mkdir`, `pwd`, `cat`, `alias`, `echo`, `help`, `set`. yeah, I know thats barely anything, I'm still working on it :P  

## Need to do:
- make many more commands (echo, set, etc...)
- allow all extensions in %PATHEXT% to be called as programs (access default programs through registry)
- enable piping
- enable access to environment variables
- **scripting** (thats a big one)
- different prompts (I want there to be a bunch of different kinds of prompts)
- initiation script
